# 📌 JSL03 – Console-Based Task Manager

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds on JSL02 by expanding the task management system. Users can add up to **three new tasks** to an existing task array. Each task is stored as an object with a unique incremental ID. Users enter task details via prompts, and the system allows filtering to view only completed tasks in the console.
