📌 JSL03 – Console-Based Task Manager

🚀 Project Overview

This project involves creating a simple task management system where users can add up to three new tasks to an existing task array. Each task is stored as an object with a unique incremental ID. Users can enter task details via prompts, and the system allows filtering to view only completed tasks in the console.

✨ Features
• Store tasks as objects inside an array for structured data management.
• Allow users to add up to three new tasks to the existing task list.
• Ensure each new task has a unique incremental ID based on the last task in the array.
• Prompt users to enter task details (title, description, status) and store them in an object.
• Alert users when they reach the task limit with the message:
“There are enough tasks on your board, please check them in the console.”
• Implement a filter function to display only tasks with the status "done".
• Log all tasks in the console with a clear label for easy review.
• Log only completed tasks (status: "done") in the console under a “Completed Tasks” label for quick reference.
